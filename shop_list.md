This is list of `shop` tags in use in Britain and Ireland in December 2025 according to taginfo, and what they are processed as in this schema.  "Rendered as icon" means it maintains its own value in the schema and the raster and vector versions of this style need to handle those values.  The other "Rendered as" values are other icons (such as "shopnonspecific") and special cases.  The notes are a mixture of mine and the OSM wikis.
